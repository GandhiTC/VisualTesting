This project is based on visual comparisons and automations.


There are examples 3 different types of testing/tools.

	- Applitools
		- A test to show the very basics of testing with Applitools
		- Be sure to go through their documents and tutorials
		- Be sure to add "APPLITOOLS_API_KEY" to your environment variables
		- Best tool for web UI testing
		
	- AShot
		- A simple image comparison using AShot
		- Not as robust as Applitools, but easier for quick and rigid tests
		
	- Sikulix
		- A useful automation tool based on visual search-and-action
		- Compared to the other 2, this tool has far more potential for
			overall automation usage
